            <h2>1940s &amp; 50s&nbsp;</h2>
            <p>The first fashion designer to create uniform for BOAC, was Maurice Helman, who gained inspiration for his creation from the world of Haute Couture against the back drop of World War II.</p>

            <h6>The look was softened slightly in the early 1950’s with an open neck blouse, no belt and made to look much more feminine in both fit and appearance. &nbsp;</h6>

            <h6>With an ever expanding route network and thus and ever expanding variation in passenger cultures, national dress uniforms for its Chinese, Indian, Pakistani and Japanese services were introduced for the first time in the mid-1950’s.&nbsp;White cheongsams, colourful saris and traditional kimonos were worn by stewardesses from these countries who spoke the relevant languages and understood the local cultures. It was an extension of BOAC’s ‘taking more care’ approach on routes which it had strong historical links, one much appreciated by passengers.</h6>

            <h2>1960s&nbsp;</h2>
            <p>The second creation for BOAC was of a very similar design to the 1952 uniform. Put together by Sir Norman Hartnell, an influential British Fashion designer and dressmaker to the Queen, the uniform was a stylish navy suit, worn with a white blouse and gloves.</p>

            <h6>The 60’s heralded a change in the perception and designs of female cabin crew uniforms. It was the birth of the ‘Jet-Set’ era, a time where style and high fashion was not just for the glamorous passengers but also for airline staff.&nbsp;The Hartnell uniforms reflected both the spirit of the time and the brand values of the growing airline. They presented classic simplicity of design while keeping its uniformed girls ‘feminine and in fashion. It was the start of a relationship with top British haute couturiers that has endured to this day.</h6>

            <h6>In 1969 BOAC introduced kimonos on their UK-Japan polar route. Each Japanese stewardess was given an allowance to to buy a kimono of their choice from their local shops, the only stipulation being that it must be of traditional design and pattern. These were eventually retired in 1974 at the request of the Japanese crew who’s stated that while they were distinctive, they were also incredibly difficult to wear while on duty.</h6>

            <h2>1970s&nbsp;</h2>
            <p>By the 1970’s fashion had become very space-age. Neil Armstrong had become the first man to set foot on the moon in 1969 and since then the world had gone space mad, including the airlines.&nbsp;In keeping with the trend BOAC enlisted the help of Britains top young courtier Clive Evans, to create a new ‘space-age’ uniform for the introduction of its brand new Boeing 747 aircraft. </p>

            <h6>Evans had won the coveted tender over leading UK designers Mary Quant and Jean Muir and his new design was incredibly different from previous uniforms, reflecting the new ‘London Look’ of the time. It was also immensely practical and versatile, suited to the demands of dealing with the increase in passengers numbers on the 747, as well as changes in climate at the growing number of destinations BOAC flew.</h6>

            <h6>A summer uniform comprised of either a coral pink or Caribbean blue terylene and cotton twill dress, with rigid geometric lines. The fabric allowed the dress to be easily washable in the crew members hotel sink and drip-dry overnight ready for the following days duty. The winter dress and smart jacket in terylene wool worsted, was also easy-care with a warm wool top-coat and boots.</h6>

            <h6>Following BEA’s lead, the carrier also permitted trousers for the first time for its female crew.&nbsp;The uniform was later adapted to for the airlines Pakistani crew. A navy blue tunic with matching trousers and white georgette hood, styled to conform to a modified type of national costume.</h6>
