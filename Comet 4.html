      <h3>Operation</h3>
          <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Cum, magnam?</p>
	<p>Comet 4 G-APDB was built at Hatfield and made its maiden flight on 27 July 1958 and was officially handed over to BOAC with its sister aircraft G-APDC on 30 September. After making a positioning flight to New York it made aviation history on 4 October when it operated the first scheduled service by a jet powered airliner from New York to London, in the then record time of 6 hours 11 minutes. At the same time DC flew in the opposite direction, from London to New York, the two Comets passing each other in mid-Atlantic when congratulatory radio messages were exchanged. The westbound flight against the prevailing wind took DC a total of 10 hours and 13 minutes, including a refuelling stop at Gander. Just 22 days later Pan American put its new Boeing 707-120s into service on the New York to Paris route and the Comet’s leadership was lost. In 1958 DB was used by the Duke of Edinburgh as his personal aircraft for his tour of Canada.</p> 
	<p>BOAC ordered 19 Comet 4s in March 1955, with G-APDA first flying on the 27th April 195. Deliveries to the airline began on 30th september 1958 with two 48 seat aircraft. The Comet 4 received a welcome response from crews and passengers but was not so well liked by the baggage handlers.As the cargo hold doors were directly underneath the aircraft so handerlers had a hard time loading cargo onboard. BOAC operated the Comets well into the late 60s until they were sold to charter airline Dan Air who used them well into the 1970s on large charter flights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
